# Over Half Element

The question is that:
```
Consider an array of n elements, A = {a1,...,an}. If an element x appears more than
n/2 times in A, x is defined to be a majority element of A. For example, 3 is a majority
element of {1,3,2,3,3}.
```
The question is how to solve this problem in O(n) complexity.
I give two codes. First is a wrong version because it fails when total number of arrary is odd in some situation.
Another approach is using stack, which I think this method is achievable.
