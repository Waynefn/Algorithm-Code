# selectMaxSubset

Consider a game of selecting a subset from a given integer sequence. The goal is to
maximize the total sum of selected numbers, but you cannot select numbers that are
adjacent. For example, if you select 5 from the sequence {1,5,2,-4,6}, you cannot
select 1 or 2 because these are adjacent to 5. Similarly, if you select 1, you cannot
select 5.
